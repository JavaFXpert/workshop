Once the program is executed on a Quantum computer, you will receive the most unbiased random answer, a *True* chance that classical computers incapable to provide. Think about a question that can be answered \"yes or no\" and run the code. Quantum 8-ball returns one of the 8 possible answers to your question. You might be already familiar with some parts of the code used in other Qiskit tutorials. \n",
